/*
Each Move module is published under a specific account address on the Aptos blockchain. This address is an integral part of the module's identity.
Module name: In addition to the address, each module has a unique name that distinguishes it from other modules published under the same address. 
By convention, a module name is written in the form "snake_case" (all letters are in lower case and words are separated by underscores).
