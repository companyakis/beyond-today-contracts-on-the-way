It might not sound like much, but it'll give us a chance to cover a lot of Rust's basics, such as:

How to define and call functions

How to declare and use variables

Primitive types (integers and booleans)

Arithmetic operators (including overflow and underflow behavior)

Comparison operators

Control flow

Panics
