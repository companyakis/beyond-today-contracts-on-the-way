// In turn, create a Move module named "my_shore", aliasing your address to "robinson".

module robinson::my_shore {

}




// It's important that each module has a unique name, as this will be used to identify the module. Here's how a module is identified:

// Each Move module is published under a specific account address on the Aptos blockchain. This address is an integral part of the module's identity.

// Module name: In addition to the address, each module has a unique name that distinguishes it from other modules published under the same address. By convention, a module name is written in the form "snake_case" 

// The account address can be stored in an alias, so you don't have to rewrite it every time.
